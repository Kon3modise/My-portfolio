<body>
        <p>I am a passionate and driven final-year BSc IT Software Engineering student with a strong interest in full-stack
        development. With experience in both frontend and backend technologies, I enjoy building seamless, user-friendly
        applications. My technical skills include HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript, Vue.js, Ruby on Rails, Java, and MySQL, and I
        have hands-on experience with Android development using Android Studio.</p>
        
       <p>I have completed internships in web development and full-stack development, where I worked on real-world projects,
        improving my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of software engineering principles. I am also
        committed to continuous learning, regularly upskilling myself through new courses and exploring new programming
        languages to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech industry.

        <p>Beyond coding, I am a huge sports fanatic more specifically atheletics and jukskei, I am a 100m and 200m athlete also I am a jukskei
        National player. I have been an athlete since grade R and I started playing jukskei in grade 8, I have played against
        Namibia in the nationals and I came first.
        I love reading books in my spare time, my favourite book of all time is Beauty beyond the orange uniform. My love for
        reading started in primary when my afrikaans teacher would always make us read books in front of the class as part of
        assessments.
